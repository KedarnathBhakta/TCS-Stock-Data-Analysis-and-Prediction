# Python 3.13 Migration: TensorFlow â†’ PyTorch

## Problem
The original deployment was failing because **TensorFlow does not support Python 3.13** as of July 2024. Streamlit Cloud was defaulting to Python 3.13, causing the error:

```
ERROR: Could not find a version that satisfies the requirement tensorflow>=2.10.0 (from versions: none)
ERROR: No matching distribution found for tensorflow>=2.10.0
```

## Solution
Migrated from **TensorFlow/Keras** to **PyTorch** for Python 3.13 compatibility.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Updated `requirements.txt`**
```diff
- tensorflow>=2.10.0,<2.16.0
+ torch>=2.0.0
```

### 2. **Updated `app_enhanced.py`**
- Replaced TensorFlow imports with PyTorch
- Created custom `LSTMModel` class using `torch.nn.Module`
- Updated training loop to use PyTorch's training paradigm
- Fixed prediction code to work with PyTorch tensors

### 3. **Updated `retrain.py`**
- Same PyTorch migration as the main app
- Updated the standalone retraining script

### 4. **Removed Version Constraints**
- Removed `runtime.txt` and `.python-version` files
- Removed `packages.txt` (not needed for PyTorch)
- Relaxed version constraints in `requirements.txt`

### 5. **Created Test Script**
- Added `test_pytorch.py` to verify PyTorch functionality

## Key Differences: TensorFlow vs PyTorch

| Aspect | TensorFlow/Keras | PyTorch |
|--------|------------------|---------|
| Model Definition | Sequential API | Custom nn.Module class |
| Training | `model.fit()` | Manual training loop |
| Predictions | `model.predict()` | `model.eval()` + `torch.no_grad()` |
| Tensor Operations | Automatic | Manual tensor conversion |

## Benefits of PyTorch Migration

âœ… **Python 3.13 Support**: Works with latest Python versions  
âœ… **Better Performance**: Often faster training and inference  
âœ… **More Control**: Explicit training loops and tensor operations  
âœ… **Active Development**: PyTorch has better Python 3.13 support  
âœ… **Same Functionality**: All original features preserved  

## Testing

Run the test script to verify everything works:
```bash
python test_pytorch.py
```

## Deployment

The app should now deploy successfully on Streamlit Cloud with Python 3.13. The migration maintains all original functionality:

- âœ… LSTM stock price prediction
- âœ… Interactive dashboard
- âœ… Model retraining
- âœ… Yahoo Finance integration
- âœ… File upload capability
- âœ… SHAP explainability
- âœ… Business metrics and visualizations

## Next Steps

1. **Commit and push** the changes to GitHub
2. **Redeploy** on Streamlit Cloud
3. **Test** the deployed application
4. **Monitor** performance and accuracy

The migration is complete and the app should now work with Python 3.13! ðŸŽ‰
